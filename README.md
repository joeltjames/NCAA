# NCAA
A stats gathering python module for the NCAA stats website.

## Goal(s)
The goal of this project is to enable users to quickly and easily gather statistical data about various sports from the NCAA website.

## Current Status
Currently, the project is being developed only for the NCAA men's basketball statistics, but I hope to expand to include other sports in the near future.

## Next Steps
Continue expanding the MBB features. Next immediate step after fully functional MBB features is to add an API.


## Installation
1. Clone the repo into your current working directory
2. Add "from NCAA import MBB" to your python files
3. Reference the functions there. (API coming soon)
